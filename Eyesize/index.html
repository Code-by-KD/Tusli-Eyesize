            <h2>About Tusli</h2>
            <p>Tusli is a revolutionary project designed to make eye care more accessible and support blind organizations. Our innovative software provides a convenient and preliminary way for individuals to test their eyesight. By analyzing various visual inputs, Tusli estimates the user's approximate eye prescription.</p>
            <p>This groundbreaking approach not only empowers individuals to take proactive steps regarding their eye health but also creates a unique connection between vision testing and charitable giving. Upon completion of the eye test, users are presented with an option to donate to blind organizations. The estimated eye prescription serves as a symbolic link to the donation amount, creating a tangible connection between personal eye health and supporting those with visual impairments.</p>
            <p><strong>Technology:</strong> Tusli utilizes advanced image processing techniques (and AI - if applicable) to analyze visual inputs and estimate eye prescriptions. (Expand on this if you have more details).</p>
