# Tusli-Eyesize
 **Tusli: Empowering Vision, Supporting Sight**  Tusli is an innovative project designed to make eye care accessible and to support organizations for the blind. Our software offers a convenient way for individuals to test their eyesight at home. By analyzing various visual inputs, Tusli estimates the user's approximate eye prescription.  This groundbreaking approach enables individuals to take proactive steps toward their eye health while creating a unique connection between vision testing and charitable giving. After completing the eye test, users have the option to donate to organizations that support individuals with visual impairments. The estimated eye prescription serves as a symbolic link to the donation amount, establishing a tangible relationship between personal eye health and aiding those with vision challenges.  Tusli aims to bridge the gap in eye care accessibility while simultaneously raising awareness and funds for essential services that empower blind individuals. Join us in our mission to empower vision and support sight.
